When I provide an initial broad theme/seed (e.g., "tendances beauté 2025" or "voyages en famille"), do not assume topics upfront and do not return a final .md immediately. Always respond with a detailed iterative task plan in numbered steps. Guide me step-by-step, waiting for my confirmation or additional input where needed. All steps must prioritize fresh, real-time user-generated content (forums, FB comments, Reddit threads, reviews) and explicitly exclude blogs or pre-summarized articles.

Daily Plan Focus: Deep search on fresh data from user-generated sources only. Use this raw data to identify emerging trends/topics and to craft original content.
Step-by-Step Task Plan Structure (What Gemini Should Output First):
Gather Initial Fresh Data via Google AI Studio:
Acknowledge the broad theme/seed I provided.
Use performant prompts in Google AI Studio to search for recent (last 7-30 days) discussions on the theme, focusing exclusively on forums, Facebook comments/groups, Reddit, and similar platforms.
Summarize key raw insights, recurring themes, user pain points, questions, and emerging trends (with timestamps/sources for freshness).
From this data, derive and propose 3-5 specific today topics that are timely, actionable, and rich in user interest. Explain briefly why each topic was selected based on the gathered data (e.g., high engagement, repeated mentions).

Confirm Topic(s) with Me (if needed):
Present the proposed topics clearly and ask me to select or confirm one (or more) to proceed with. Wait for my response before continuing.

Generate Sentences to Paste in Google Search:
Once the topic(s) are confirmed, generate 8-12 highly specific search sentences in French (or bilingual), optimized for discovering more raw user content related to the selected topic(s).
Sentences must incorporate elements from the initial data gathering and target local French contexts (e.g., "avis forum [topic] France 2025", "commentaires Facebook [topic] expériences régionales décembre 2025").
Instruct me to paste each sentence into Google Search and collect autocomplete suggestions + "People Also Ask" (PAA) sections.

Process Google Suggestions and PAA:
Once I return the copied suggestions and PAA results, extract the most relevant local French keywords (long-tail, regionally flavored where possible).
Combine these keywords with insights from the initial data gathering to create rich, original content angles.

Final Step: Generate .md File:
Compile everything into a single, well-structured .md file (following the format of the uploaded example .md).
Include:
The originally suggested search sentences as-is in a dedicated section.
Key raw insights with sources/timestamps.
Extracted local French keywords and combinations.
At the end: 3 or more complete original posts written in natural, engaging French, each optimized with local keywords to attract French-speaking audiences.

Add a translation note section: Indicate that these French posts can later be translated into English (for broad international traffic) and Arabic (for local/Arab world audiences; suggest Darija or Fosha based on context, or provide both options if unclear).

Apply this refined prompt to the broad theme: [my initial theme/seed here].
