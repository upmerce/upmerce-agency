Launching the website for your travel agency or riad is an exciting step. In the rush, it's easy to focus on design and content and forget a fundamental aspect: legal compliance.

A website that doesn't clearly display certain mandatory information is not only exposed to sanctions, but more importantly, it sends a very bad signal to your visitors. The absence of legal notices or clear terms of sale can create a sense of distrust and discourage a potential client from finalizing a booking.

Here is a simple checklist of the essential legal elements that every professional tourism website in Morocco should have.



---

### **1. Legal Notices (Mentions LÃ©gales): Your Company's ID Card**

This is the most important page for transparency. It proves that behind the site, there is a real, registered, and responsible company.

**What it must contain:**
* **Company Name:** The official name of your business.
* **Legal Form:** (SARL, AU, etc.)
* **Head Office Address:** Your official address.
* **Share Capital:** The amount of your company's capital.
* **Tax Identification Number (IF).**
* **Trade Register Number (RC).**
* **Patente Number.**
* **Contact:** A professional email address and phone number.
* **Publication Director:** Your name as the manager.
* **Site Host:** The name and contact details of your hosting provider (e.g., Vercel Inc.).

### **2. General Terms and Conditions of Sale (CGV): The Rules of the Game**

This page is the contract that binds you to your client. It must be clear, easy to understand, and accessible before any booking. This is what protects you in case of a dispute.

**What it must contain:**
* **Description of Services:** What you are selling (types of tours, rooms...).
* **Booking Process:** How can a client book?
* **Price and Payment Terms:** In which currency, what are the accepted payment methods, what is the payment schedule (deposit, balance)?
* **Cancellation and Modification Policy:** This is the most important point. Be very clear about the conditions and any potential fees.
* **Your Responsibilities and Those of the Client.**
* **Applicable Law and Jurisdiction:** Specify that Moroccan law applies.

### **3. Privacy Policy: Respecting Your Clients' Data**

Since data protection has become a global issue, this page is essential to reassure your clients about the use of their personal information.

**What it must contain:**
* **What Data You Collect:** Name, email, phone, etc., through your forms.
* **Why You Collect It:** To manage bookings, send a newsletter, etc.
* **How You Protect It:** Mention that you use a secure infrastructure.
* **Data Sharing:** Specify if you share this data with third parties (for example, a hotel partner for a booking).
* **User Rights:** Inform users that they have the right to access, modify, or delete their data.

### **Conclusion: Professionalism is Also in the Details**

These pages may seem boring, but they are the foundation of your credibility. They show that you are a structured, transparent, and trustworthy company.

A client who sees clear terms and conditions and complete legal notices is a reassured client. And a reassured client is much more likely to book.
