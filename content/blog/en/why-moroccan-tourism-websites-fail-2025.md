# Why Most Moroccan Tourism Websites Fail in 2025  
*(And How the Smartest Owners Are Quietly Taking Back Control)*

I just did something a little insane.

I spent two full weeks pretending to be a new riad owner shopping for a website.  
I contacted 27 local agencies.  
I read every single “partner” page of Booking.com and Viator.  
I reverse-engineered the most beautiful, highest-converting independent tourism sites in Morocco.

Here’s what I discovered — in plain, brutal numbers and screenshots.

## Part 1: The Two Hidden Taxes That Are Killing Your Margins

### Tax #1 – The Classic Moroccan Web Agency Trap

| What They Promise | What You Actually Get | Real Cost (2025 prices) |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| “Custom hotel website” | Identical beige WordPress theme used on 50 other riads | 20,000–50,000 MAD |
| “We handle everything” | You call them every time you want to change breakfast price | +6,000–15,000 MAD/year “maintenance” |
| “Professional booking engine” | A $29/month plugin they rebrand | Extra every year |

> Real quote received this week (December 2025):  
> “The site is 28,000 MAD + 9,600 MAD/year for hosting, updates and security. If you want to modify anything yourself, we charge 450 MAD/hour.”

Three agencies I contacted this month still don’t show a **single hotel project** in their portfolio.  
Two of them don’t even have pricing pages — because transparency kills recurring revenue.

### Tax #2 – The OTA “Partnership” That Costs You 450,000 MAD/Year

| Platform | Commission in Morocco (2025) | Charged on | Source (official partner page) |
|----------|-----------------------------|------------|-------------------------------|
| Booking.com | 15% average (up to 25% with Genius & promotions) | Total amount + taxes + fees + no-shows | [partner.booking.com → commission](https://partner.booking.com/en-us/help/commission-invoices-tax/commission/understanding-our-commission) |
| Viator / Tripadvisor | 8% fixed on tours & activities | Every booking made through their link | [partnerhelp.viator.com](https://partnerhelp.viator.com/en/articles/122-how-much-is-the-commission-for-travel-agents) |

That “free visibility” everyone talks about?  
It’s the most expensive marketing you’ll ever buy.

## Part 2: The Independent Riads That Are Laughing at OTAs

While 90% of owners complain about commissions, a small group has gone completely rogue — and they’re winning.

### Example #1 – Riad Kheirredine (Marrakech)
- #1 on Tripadvisor with 3,000+ reviews  
- Not a single Booking.com widget on the entire site  
- Huge “Best Rate Guaranteed – Book Direct” banner  
- Lightning-fast mobile experience with instant availability  
- Charges 20–30% more than neighboring riads and still stays full

### Example #2 – Riad Alkemia (Marrakech)
- Full privatization model (weddings, retreats)  
- 9.9/10 rating with emotional, story-driven testimonials  
- Direct-booking perks: free airport transfer + daily cleaning  
- Zero third-party dependency

These sites didn’t win by accident.  
They invested **once** in a real weapon instead of paying rent forever.

## Part 3: The 2026 Playbook (Copy-Paste What Actually Works)

Here’s exactly what the top 5% are doing right now:

1. **One-time payment** (no annual hostage fees)  
2. **100% ownership** of domain, content, and booking engine  
3. **Zero commission** on direct bookings  
4. Design that looks more premium than Booking.com itself  
5. Built-in WhatsApp recovery, dynamic pricing, and upsell packages  

> Math for a 12-room riad doing 3 million MAD/year via OTAs:  
> → 450,000–600,000 MAD lost in commissions alone  
> A proper direct-booking system pays for itself in 4–7 months.  
> After that? Pure profit.

## Final Thought

If you’re still:
- Paying an agency every time you update your spa menu  
- Watching 15–25% of every booking disappear  
- Running a website that looks identical to your competitor’s  

…2026 is the year everything can change.

I’m putting the finishing touches on a solution that removes both taxes forever — no annual contracts, no hidden fees, built exclusively for Moroccan riads, boutique hotels, desert camps and tour operators.
