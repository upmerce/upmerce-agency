Let's take a standard agency based in a tourism hub like Marrakech or Bali, doing **$100,000** in annual turnover.

If, like the market average, 80% of your bookings come via Booking.com or Viator at 20% commission, here is the reality of your accounts:
**$16,000** of your hard work goes directly into the platform's pocket. Every year.

### **1. The "Billboard Effect" Leak**

Think you can't survive without them? Think again.
Statistics show that **50% of users** see your hotel or agency on an OTA, then search for your official name on Google to see if it's cheaper direct. This is the "Billboard Effect".

**The Crime Scene:**
These users arrive at your official site.
* If it loads in more than 4 seconds (due to WordPress bloat)...
* If the booking engine is complicated...
* If the payment looks suspicious...

**70% of them return to the OTA.**
By having a slow site, you are literally paying Booking.com $16,000/year for the "privilege" of failing to serve your own customers.

### **2. The Recovery Strategy**

Imagine investing just $5,000 once in a high-performance Direct Booking Engine (Upmerce).

If you shift just **30%** of your OTA traffic to your direct site (thanks to speed and UX):
* You save **$4,800** in the first year alone.
* Your site pays for itself in 12 months.
* The following years are pure profit.

### **3. Conclusion**

In 2025, speed is not a technical luxury. It is your only defense against commission bleeding. Build your direct channel, build it fast, and own the rails.
