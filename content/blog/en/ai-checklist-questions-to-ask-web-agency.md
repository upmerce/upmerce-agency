In 2025, nearly every web agency will tell you they "use AI." But this statement is meaningless without context. It's like a restaurant telling you they "use fire" to cook. It's a given, but it tells you nothing about the quality of the final dish.

To make an informed choice, you need to ask smarter questions. You need to go beyond the marketing to understand if AI is being used as a simple gimmick, or if it's serving your performance.

Here is a checklist of questions to ask any web agency to make the right choice.

### **Question About Content**

**❌ Don't ask:** "Do you use AI to write the content?"
* **Why it's a bad question:** The answer is often "yes," but this hides the fact that the content will be generic and soulless, which is a disaster for a tourism brand that sells authenticity.

**✅ Ask instead:** "What is your philosophy on using AI for content, and how do you guarantee that my company's unique voice and expertise will be preserved?"
* **Why it's a good question:** This forces the agency to reveal its strategy. A quality agency will explain that they use AI tools for research or proofreading, but that the core of the message, the story, and the expertise must remain human. This is the only right answer.

### **Question About Performance**

**❌ Don't ask:** "Will the site be fast?"
* **Why it's a bad question:** Everyone will say "yes." It's an empty promise without proof.

**✅ Ask instead:** "How does your infrastructure, particularly through AI, guarantee maximum loading speed for my clients, whether they are in Marrakech or New York?"
* **Why it's a good question:** You are not asking for a promise; you are asking for an explanation of their system. A cutting-edge agency will tell you about its intelligent distribution network (like Vercel's Edge Network) that uses AI to serve your site from the closest point to each visitor. This is a concrete and verifiable answer.

### **Question About Security**

**❌ Don't ask:** "Will the site be secure?"
* **Why it's a bad question:** Again, the answer will always be "yes."

**✅ Ask instead:** "What is your approach to security? Is it reactive (based on security plugins that need updating) or proactive (built into the architecture)?"
* **Why it's a good question:** This reveals their philosophy. A reactive approach (typical of WordPress) means the burden of security rests on you and constant updates. A proactive and intelligent approach (like that of Google Firebase) means security is managed by systems that learn and adapt automatically, offering you true peace of mind.

### **Question About Dependency**

**❌ Don't ask:** "Will I be the owner of my site?"
* **Why it's a bad question:** Most agencies will say "yes," but the definition of "owner" is vague.

**✅ Ask instead:** "Will my site depend on an ecosystem of third-party plugins for its essential features? And how is AI used to ensure the stability of the system?"
* **Why it's a good question:** You get to the heart of the dependency problem. An honest agency will explain if your site is a "house of cards" made of plugins or a coherent structure. A modern agency will explain how the AI of its infrastructure (like Firebase) ensures the reliability of services, without depending on dozens of small developers.

### **Conclusion: AI is a Tool, Not a Magic Solution**

Artificial intelligence is an incredibly powerful tool, but its value depends entirely on the hand of the craftsman who wields it.

Don't be impressed by the mere word "AI." Use this checklist to find a partner who doesn't use it as a marketing buzzword, but as a real lever to build a faster, more secure, and more powerful website.
