As financial auditors for the tourism sector, we often see the same pattern: an agency chooses the "easy" solution at $30/month, thinking they are saving money.

This is a fundamental calculation error.

We compared the **TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)** over 5 years between a "Standard" SaaS setup (Wix/Shopify + Apps) and a "Mulk" construction (Proprietary Next.js). The numbers are non-negotiable.

### **1. The Table of Truth (5-Year Projection)**

Here is the reality of hidden costs that platforms don't show you:

| Year | Scenario A: The Rental (Wix/SaaS) | Scenario B: The Ownership (Upmerce/Mulk) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Year 1** | **$1,800** (Subscription + Apps + Setup) | **$4,500** (Custom Dev + API) |
| **Year 2** | **$950** (Price hikes + New Apps) | **$200** (Managed Hosting) |
| **Year 3** | **$1,100** (Scaling fees) | **$200** (Maintenance) |
| **Year 4** | **$1,300** (Marketplace commissions) | **$200** (Maintenance) |
| **Year 5** | **$1,500** (Premium Support) | **$500** (Major Update) |
| **TOTAL** | **$6,650** (Sunk Cost) | **$5,600** (Valuable Asset) |

### **2. The Auditor's Verdict**

By Year 4, the "cheap" SaaS solution becomes more expensive than high-end custom development. But the crucial difference lies elsewhere:

* **With Scenario A (Rental):** You spent $6,650 for **zero assets**. If you stop paying, everything vanishes. You are a tenant in a "Digital Hotel" where the landlord raises the rent every year.
* **With Scenario B (Mulk):** You invested $5,600 in **Intellectual Property**. The code belongs to you. It is a "Digital Fortress" that you can resell, modify, or move.

### **3. The 2025 Strategy**

Stop viewing your website as an electricity bill (an expense). View it as real estate (an investment).
